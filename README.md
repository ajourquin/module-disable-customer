# Ajourquin_DisableCustomer

This extension allows you to disable a customer from admin.

* Once a customer is disabled, he cannot log in on storefront anymore. 
* A message is displayed that the account is disabled when trying to log in.  

## How it works

In admin choose a client for which you want to disable the account.

Then go to "Account Information" tab and turn on "Account disabled".

You can also view in "Personal Information" section in "Customer view" the current status of the account.
