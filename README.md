# Ajourquin_DisableCustomer

This extension allows you to disable a customer from admin.

* Once a customer is disabled, he cannot log in on storefront anymore. 
* A message is displayed that the account is disabled when trying to log in.  

## How it works

In admin choose a client for which you want to disable the account.

Then go to "**Account Information**" tab and turn on "**Account disabled**".

You can also view in "**Personal Information**" section in "**Customer view**" the current status of the account.
